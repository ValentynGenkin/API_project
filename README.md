This tool allows you to effortlessly create your own API. Simply follow a few steps to set up your MongoDB schema and define standard endpoints for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

1. Create MongoDB Schema: Define the data structure for your API by selecting the necessary fields. Our tool will automatically generate a ready-to-use MongoDB schema for you.

2. Define Standard CRUD Endpoints: You have four standard endpoints for basic operations:

Create: Add new data to your database.
Read: Retrieve data from the database for viewing or using in your application.
Update: Modify existing data in the database according to your needs.
Delete: Remove data from the database that you no longer need.
3. Integrate Your API: Get the generated generated endpoints and easily integrate it into your application. Your API is now ready to use with four standard CRUD endpoints.
